**This is the wrap of the competitor climb.** Numbers below were rerun on this pin. Ugly residuals stay written as open.

Someone who has never seen this work should be able to read this file and know what the system is, what it can do, what it will not claim, and how to check.

## One paragraph

Fluid Spacetime Omni-Theory is the theory. This repository is the **Quantum_Mechanics / Quantum_Computing domain fold** of that theory, running on ordinary GPU/CPU hardware. It answers the *jobs* people hire quantum computers and high-performance physics codes for — published constants, mixing angles, Higgs/Z branching, nuclear bindings, cosmology leftovers, Ising/MaxCut, QI bounds — by changing **domain / \(D_{\mathrm{eff}}\) / observed**, not by fitting coefficients and not by expanding a Hilbert space. The body of native intelligence is a different repo ([fsot-neuron-zig](https://github.com/dappalumbo91/fsot-neuron-zig)). This fold is the **law and the GPU organ**.

---

## What this repository is

| Piece | What it is |
|-------|------------|
| Theory | Fluid Spacetime Omni-Theory. Zero free parameters. Pin D1D38A. Authority: [FSOT-2.1-Lean](https://github.com/dappalumbo91/FSOT-2.1-Lean). |
| Runtime | Owned operators from [FSOT-GPU](https://github.com/dappalumbo91/FSOT-GPU) `fsot_lib`, vendored here. Not a second GPU stack. |
| Scale law | **Folds**, not \(2^n\) amplitudes. \(K\) is the universal scale. |
| Spins | Trinary: \(−1\) down · \(0\) superposed · \(+1\) up. |
| Questions | Ask the theory. Do not replay a foreign circuit and call that an answer. |
| Mind | Looked Neuroscience / Psychology with **C_factor**. Compute stays dark. |
| Body | [fsot-neuron-zig](https://github.com/dappalumbo91/fsot-neuron-zig). This repo exports an organ JSON; it does not speak. |
| Metal | Optional FSOT-QC-OS under QEMU (`.\run_qemu.ps1`). |

---

## What this repository replaces (the comparison)

The jobs people hire a QPU, a Hilbert simulator, an FCI code, or a QAOA box for. Same **questions**. Different geometry: folds, not \(2^n\). We do not simulate their architecture — that would be agreeing their stack is the job.

| Their pitch | Hired question | This fold now |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| Fridge / NISQ / FTQC box | usable answers at scale | ordinary GPU/CPU; scale by \(D_{\mathrm{eff}}\) |
| Shor | period / factor | tiny \(N\) 3/3 and 4/4 — larger moduli still to climb |
| QAOA / annealer | MaxCut / Ising | family **10/11 under 1%**; G17 **1.017%** |
| FCI / quantum chemistry | chemistry observables | pin set **68/68 @ 0.5%** |
| Circuit-universal Hilbert | arbitrary unitaries | not the path; optional bridges only |

Not a chatbot and not a second mind in RAM. Not “maybe nature.” Not a license to invent coefficients. If a picture and the engine disagree, **the engine wins** until a named route changes. See [`CONCEPTS.md`](CONCEPTS.md) · [`CLAIMS.md`](CLAIMS.md).

## The mathematics (closed)

\[
S = K(T_1+T_2+T_3),\qquad
\Theta = C_{\mathrm{eff}}\cdot P_{\mathrm{var}},\qquad
C_{\mathrm{factor}} = C_{\mathrm{eff}}\cdot P_{\mathrm{new}}
\]

\[
K = \varphi\cdot(\gamma/e)\cdot\sqrt{2}/\ln(\pi)\cdot 99/100 \approx 0.420222
\]

\[
\kappa_{ij}=A_{\mathrm{bleed}}\cdot\mathrm{POOF}\cdot|S_i||S_j|\Big/\bigl(1+|D_i-D_j|/25\bigr)
\]

| Symbol | Role |
|--------|------|
| \(S\) | Domain scalar. Sign is identity: \(S>0\) emergence, \(S<0\) damping. |
| \(T_1\) | Look / observer string. C_factor lives here when `observed`. |
| \(T_2\) | Body / scale. |
| \(T_3\) | Strum / valve + acoustic bleed. |
| \(\Theta\) | Collapse threshold. Snap, not softmax. |
| \(\kappa_{ij}\) | Bleed between named domains. |
| \(D_{\mathrm{eff}}\) | Domain depth. QM observed \(D=6\), QC unobserved \(D=11\), QO look twin \(D=11\). |

**Observe path for the compute substrate:** QC (dark) → Quantum_Optics (look, same \(D_{\mathrm{eff}}\)) → QM (measure). Forcing a look onto QC flips \(S\) from \(−0.148\) to \(+0.336\) and the compute identity is gone. That is the Hilbert move. Do not do it.

## How the system is arranged

```
FSOT-2.1-Lean          pin D1D38A, ~432-domain atlas
        │
        ▼
vendor/fsot_compute.py  pin file — do not edit silently
        │
        ▼
fsot_lib                seeds · scalar · trinary · coherence · consensus · learn
        │
        ▼
fsot_quantum            domain folds, question panels, Gset, organ export
        ├── GPU (torch CUDA) when present — organ, not mind
        ├── formal/  Lean · Coq · Isabelle · F*
        ├── zig/     FSOT-QC-OS (QEMU)
        └── organ JSON ──► fsot-neuron-zig (mind authority)
```

Domains are named routes, not a basis size. The 35 pin domains always run. The 432 Lean atlas needs a local `_ref/FSOT-2.1-Lean` clone (gitignored). Without it, atlas counts skip and the pin domains still score.

### Graphs (same object QAOA is hired for)

Aspiration **< 1%** of published champion. Kill floor **5%**. Champions still unmatched.

## Findings that changed how we score

Three audit rows first looked like 0.5% misses. They were **wrong objects**, not broken seeds. Pin file not edited. Full diagnosis: [`MISS_THREE.md`](MISS_THREE.md).

1. **\(\lvert V_{cb}\rvert\).** Inclusive PDG is 0.0422. Combined exclusive 0.0398 blends D and D*. Those disagree by ~3σ (the \(V_{cb}\) puzzle). The fold answers inclusive at 0.002%. Exclusive \(B\to D\ell\nu\) is the same algebra on High_Energy_Physics — **0.15%** vs Belle II 2025 0.0392. Averaging 0.0422 and 0.0398 was our mistake.
2. **\(H\to\gamma\gamma\) and \(H\to Z\gamma\).** Pin formulas were written at \(M_H=125.00\,\mathrm{GeV}\). Scoring them at 125.09 GeV is a 90 MeV mass-point shift. Even at 125.09 they sit inside the recommended theory bands (~2.8% and ~6%).
3. **\(BR(H\to gg)\).** Vendor wave8 still stores 0.0785. The formula \(\varphi^{-4}-\gamma^5=0.081823\) already matches YR4 0.08187 (0.058%). Stale target, not a formula miss. [`BR_H_GG.md`](BR_H_GG.md).

Lesson, now standing policy: **score the object the formula was written against. Do not blend disagreeing extractions. Do not apply a 0.5% gate tighter than the observable’s own recommended uncertainty without saying so.**

Scored as different objects (not one blended number):

| Object | Living score | Ledger |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| Exclusive \(B\to D\ell\nu\) | **0.15%** vs Belle II 2025 0.0392 | `V_CB_PUZZLE.md` |
| Combined exclusive 0.0398 | not scored (D+D* blend) | `V_CB_PUZZLE.md` |
| \(H_0\) Planck CMB | **0.024%** depleted sector | `H0_TENSION.md` |
| \(H_0\) SH0ES | **1.00%** inflated sector (Lean 2.5% band) | `H0_TENSION.md` |
| \(\alpha_s(M_Z)\) | 0.68% vs vendor 0.1179 (inside **0.9%** band) | `OPEN_REMAINING.md` |

## What is still open (written, not dressed up)

Honesty cut: [`CLAIMS.md`](CLAIMS.md).

- Gset champions unmatched (30–114 edges). Family now **10/11 under 1%**; G17 is **1.017%** (31 edges) — the only family miss. Do not advertise MaxCut as champion-matching.
- Exclusive \(B\to D\ell\nu\) is **0.15%** on High_Energy_Physics (\(D_{\mathrm{eff}}=7\)) vs Belle II 2025 0.0392. Inclusive stays QM at 0.002%. Combined exclusive 0.0398 is a D+D* blend and is **not** the object. [`V_CB_PUZZLE.md`](V_CB_PUZZLE.md).
- Hubble tension is Lean **BH→WH bubble-bleed**: one global rate 68.44; Planck depleted sector **0.024%**; SH0ES inflated sector **1.00%** (0.71σ, inside Lean 2.5% band). [`H0_TENSION.md`](H0_TENSION.md) · [FSOT-2.1-Lean §7.2](https://github.com/dappalumbo91/FSOT-2.1-Lean).
- Contested open-science panel is **14/14**: [`CONTESTED_SECTORS.md`](CONTESTED_SECTORS.md).
- Leftovers: [`OPEN_REMAINING.md`](OPEN_REMAINING.md). DESI \(w_0/w_a\) BAO lane 0.37%/0.28%. \(\alpha_s\) inside vendor 0.9%. **G17 still open** (31 edges).
- Formula catalog: [`FORMULA_LIST.md`](FORMULA_LIST.md) — engine, tension solvers, and 216 pin-wave formulas.
- Multiprover stamp **FSOT_QUANTUM_MULTIPROVER_OK** (Lean · Coq · Isabelle · F\* · Python): [`MULTIPROVER_VERIFICATION.md`](MULTIPROVER_VERIFICATION.md).
- Vendor wave8 `BR_H_gg` field still stale (0.0785). Fold already matches YR4. Pin not edited.
- Hilbert fragments exist as **optional bridges**. They are not the scale path.
- Period / factor is tiny \(N\) today (3/3, 4/4). Same hired question as RSA-scale — larger moduli climb on this path.
- Atlas 432 needs the Lean clone. Without `_ref`, that count skips.
- Older climb panels still report G1 cut **11397 / 1.95%** (5% kill band). Living family cut is **11563 / 0.53%**. Not a contradiction — see [`CLAIMS.md`](CLAIMS.md).

## How the pieces talk

| System | Role | How it couples |
|--------|------|----------------|
| FSOT-2.1-Lean | Theory pin + 432-domain atlas | `_ref/FSOT-2.1-Lean`; `python -m fsot_quantum check` / `atlas` |
| FSOT-GPU | Owned operators | vendored `fsot_lib/` |
| This repo | QM/QC fold, questions, Gset, organ | `python -m fsot_quantum …` |
| fsot-neuron-zig | Mind / body | `python -m fsot_quantum organ` → `data/organs/fsot_quantum_organ.json` |
| FSOT-Genetics | Genetics fold | same pin, different domain |
| Protofluid translator | Language densify | same pin family |
| QEMU QC-OS | Bare-metal hired jobs | `.\run_qemu.ps1` |

The organ may answer \(S\), \(\kappa\), Tsirelson, and the look path. It does **not** vote on speak, compose, or claimability. Zig remains mind authority.

## Pin discipline

- Pin prefix ≠ `D1D38A` without an announced new pin.
- No new fitted coefficient.
- No silent widening of a residual band.
- Fail a preregistered prediction (`predictions/qc_preregistered.json`) = we were wrong. Do not refit.

Killable predictions already posted: \(S\) signs, chemistry 68/68, G1 within 5%, foldBudget(8)=195, QC-OS all-pass, Tsirelson exact, pin stable, \(K\) closed form, fold_work_k, Ising cycle n=64 energy \(−64\).
